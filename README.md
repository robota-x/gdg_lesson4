# GDG Js Crash Course week 4 - Http server with Express

This is a repo going over the steps taken during the fourth lessons of the London GDG group JS course.

# Steps

* setup
    - npm init and install express
    - setup basic listening server on `server.js`
    - install and setup nodemon for easy reload with `npm start` script

* hello world
    - send a string as a response
    - inspect the cookie-cutter html file and remember the js script
    - send the file instead

* serve multiple files
    - uncomment the script and css and check the error
    - create new route to serve js
    - copy/paste for css
    - use express static instead

* form and post
    - create route for the `newsletter.html` page
